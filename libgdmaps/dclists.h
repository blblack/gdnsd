// At the nlist/ntree layer, a uint32_t node reference has the high bit set
//   if it's a dclist, and cleared if it's an internal tree-node reference.
// This implies that legal, real dclist indices used in the construction of
//   struct nlist and struct ntree cannot have the high bit set, ever, and thus our
//   list of real dclist indices is a 31-bit value.
// As a further constraint, the maximal 31-bit value is not allowed for a real
//   dclist index because it is used in two magic ways:
//   1) At the dclists/dcmap/gdgeoip layer it's used to signal automatic
//     distance-mapped mapping (DCLIST_AUTO below), which will be translated
//     to a real dclist index before passing to the nlist/tree layer.
//   2) NN_UNDEF is the 'undefined' case at the nlist/tree layer and is the
//     value UINT32_MAX, and we don't want a legit dclist index, when OR'd
//     with the high-bit at the ntree layer, to overlap with this definition
//     of NN_UNDEF.
// Therefore:
#define DCLIST_AUTO 0x7FFFFFFF
#define DCLIST_MAX  0x7FFFFFFE
