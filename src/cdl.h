/* CDL - Counted Doubly-linked List
 *
 * Macro-based doubly-linked list with struct-internal pointers and a distinct
 * "root" structure which has pointers to the head and tail elements of the
 * real list.  Also tracks the count of elements, as this is common for our
 * use-cases which matter the most.
 *
 * We've chosen to avoid the Linux container_of() route over all the
 * complexities about types/typeof, alignment, aliasing, and/or standards
 * confusion, and instead we've done something closer to the BSD-style
 * sys/queue.h way of defining things.  The downside is the macro arguments and
 * the code are both a little more verbose than they need to be, and the list
 * root is a distinct type from the entries.  Either way we'd want the
 * implementation to be local here to be sure it's portable and that we can
 * fully control the detailed semantics and implications.  I find many of the
 * existing examples of this kind of thing to have really confusing terminology
 * (especially "head"), so we'll explain ours here.
 *
 * Terminology, when used in macro names, argument names, etc:
 * "root"  - The root structure of a list.  This is not a list member
 *           structure; it is a distinct type which only contains two pointers
 *           to the head (first) and tail (last) elements (which are of the
 *           real data type of the elements of the list).  It is initialized to
 *           the empty state with both pointers as NULL, and after adding some
 *           elements and then removing all elements, both pointers will again
 *           become to NULL to represent the empty state.
 * "type"  - The type of the actual list elements.
 * "entry" - The member of "type" which holds an element's next/prev pointers.
 * "obj"   - A pointer to an actual, existing input list element of type "type"
 *           (or in the case of for-loop iterators: the name of the iteration
 *           pointer that will be made available to the loop)
 * "head"  - The head element of type "type" in the list's ordering (its prev
 *           pointer is NULL).
 * "tail"  - The tail element of type "type" in the list's ordering (its next
 *           pointer is NULL).
 *
 * Initialization:
 * "root" objects must be initialized to zero (e.g. memset, calloc, or = { 0 }
 * as appropriate).  "entry" within a struct probably should be initialized to
 * zero in the general case, but can be left uninitialized so long as the first
 * operation on the entry is to add it to a list root.
 *
 * Also, macros/vars ending in "_" are meant to be private to this file!
